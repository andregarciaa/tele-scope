read eudaq raw data files
     libeudaq has decoder for Mimosa telescope planes by default
     build eudaq with support for your DUT:
       cd eudaq/build
       cmake -DBUILD_cmspixel=ON ..

step 0:
     prepare a geo.dat file with the telescope and DUT/REF planes

step 1: teles triplet alignment
     > tele -g geo.dat 20833
     (writes align_20833.dat and hot_20833.dat)
     iterate at least once

step 2: telescope with DUT and REF
     prepare a runs.dat file with any needed constants
     > scope 20833
     (reads runs.dat, which contains a link to geo.dat)
     (reads align.dat and hot.dat)
     (write alignDUT.dat)
     iterate 3 times
